Introduction
----
This research project is related to personalized gamification. We present an approach for personalizing gamification to the needs of each individual person. The result of the design process is a context-aware and personalized gamification ruleset for collaborative environments. We also present a method translating gamification rulesets to machine-readable classifier algorithm using the CN2 rule inducer and a framework for connecting the produced algorithm to collaborative software. Lastly, we present an example software for personalized gamification that was produced by applying the process presented in this paper. More details and the design process are available in the conference paper that will be available in the fall.

Repository contents
----
The repository has two directories: algorithm and python. algorithm directory has the CN2-based gamification approach classifier and python has the proof of concept software that allows testing of the algorithm. The algorithm directory has more information about the input and other classifier -related details in that directory's README. The python directory has a README with more information about the software.

Science!
----
The publication is under review. Link and conference details will be published later in 2017.
